# Quicksort Algorithm: Implementation, Analysis, and Randomization  
MSCS 532 – Algorithms and Data Structures  
University of the Cumberlands  

---

## Overview

This project implements both deterministic and randomized versions of the Quicksort algorithm in Python. It includes:

- Theoretical time and space complexity analysis
- Empirical performance comparison
- Statistical evaluation (average and standard deviation)
- Analysis of the impact of randomization

The implementation is based on concepts from:

##  Implementation Details

### Deterministic Quicksort
- Uses Lomuto partition scheme
- Pivot = last element
- Worst-case behavior on sorted/reverse-sorted inputs

### Randomized Quicksort
- Random pivot selection
- Reduces probability of worst-case O(n²)
- Maintains expected O(n log n)

---

## Empirical Analysis

Each experiment was executed:

- 10 independent trials
- For input sizes: 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000
- For input types:
  - Random
  - Sorted
  - Reverse Sorted

For each configuration, we computed:

- Average running time
- Standard deviation

Results are saved in:
```bash


results/results.csv
```

## Sample Output

Example benchmark execution:


Completed n=1000, case=random
Completed n=1000, case=sorted
Completed n=1000, case=reverse
...
Results saved to results/results.csv


Example CSV output:


Size,Case,Algorithm,Average Time (s),Std Dev (s)
1000,random,Deterministic,0.00121,0.00008
1000,random,Randomized,0.00118,0.00005

##  Key Observations

1. Deterministic Quicksort performs efficiently on random inputs.
2. Deterministic Quicksort degrades significantly on sorted inputs.
3. Deep recursion was observed for sorted input, reflecting worst-case O(n²).
4. Randomized Quicksort maintained stable performance across all input types.
5. Standard deviation values confirmed lower performance variability for randomized Quicksort.

## 📈Theoretical Alignment

- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n²)
- Space Complexity (average): O(log n)
- Space Complexity (worst): O(n)

Empirical results strongly align with theoretical analysis from CLRS (2022).

## What I Learned

Through this assignment, I learned:

- How pivot selection directly impacts recursion depth
- Why worst-case O(n²) is not just theoretical but observable
- How randomization improves algorithmic stability
- The importance of running multiple trials and computing statistical measures
- How empirical data supports theoretical complexity analysis
